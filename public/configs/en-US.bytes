In this mad post-apocalyptic world, she fights despair with speed and tears through the silence with fury.";
"item_description_key1005002"="Though she looks young, Nicole's aura rivals that of seasoned officers. Strong-willed and optimistic, she carries a deep sense of responsibility. Just a week on the job when the zombie outbreak hit, she stayed at her post, directing traffic and aiding evacuations.

Her courage has inspired many, making her a new beacon of hope.";
"item_description_key1005003"="Emily was a devoted maid to the Audrey family, meticulous and gentle. Before the outbreak, she tended to the mansion and lit the fireplace daily.

"item_description_key1005005"="Aurora was once a devout nun who lived peacefully in a remote church. The apocalypse shattered her world.

"item_description_key1005006"="Sophia is the pinnacle of human technology. As a cyborg, her body has undergone countless experiments, granting her superhuman strength and agility. When facing zombie hordes, she remains calm and executes every command with precision.

Embodying human intellect but lacking emotion, she walks alone through the apocalypse.";
"item_description_key1005007"="In the post-apocalyptic ruins, survival makes people cautious, but not Madison. As the rebel of the Lightning team, she lives boldly and freely. To her, the apocalypse isn't the start of despair. Madison relishes in others' panic, like a mischievous imp, displaying her flair and madness across the wasteland.

Despite sometimes causing minor chaos with her spirited nature, Kiki's warmth and kindness melt the ice in people's hearts, believing that even in the apocalypse, one should live vibrantly.";
"item_description_key1005009"="Chika Shiraishi, true to her name, is calm and resilient. As Audrey's loyal bodyguard, her devotion runs deep.

"item_description_key1005010"=""Brainless idiots!" Kanade scoffed, efficiently dispatching a lone zombie.

Facing a charging zombie dog, her high-pressure water gun became a deadly weapon, turning the beast into minced meat. In that moment, she found newfound confidence, her eyes shining with unprecedented determination. As zombie hordes grew, her water gun struggled to keep up. Remembering her college chemistry classes, she began using toxic chemicals in her bottles. The zombies that touched the poison instantly rotted, their screams echoing through the streets.";
"item_description_key1005012"="Once a dazzling phoenix on stage, Flame's passionate voice and enchanting dance moves transported audiences into a world of dreams and fervor. But when the apocalypse struck, she lost both her stage and the fire that fueled her spirit. She picked up a guitar, strumming a powerful tune, her music igniting flames that seemed to dance with her. No longer the bright phoenix, Flame became the fire dancer of the apocalypse, using her music to kindle hope and banish darkness. Her voice turned into a weapon, combating despair and fear.";
"item_description_key1005013"="At dawn in the apocalypse, Gabrielle moves across keyboards like a sprite, her fingertips sparking with brilliance as she effortlessly cracks Tyrell Corporation's digital labyrinth.

"item_description_key1005014"="Zoe was the ace of a special ops unit, obedience her creed. In the chaos of anarchy, she was lost, like a serpent with its fangs broken. One day, she met an intriguing girl who claimed to be from the Eden organization. Initially dismissive of this unreliable character, Zoe soon found that the girl's seemingly offhand remarks hit the mark, awakening a long-lost sense of order and belonging. The brand of "absolute obedience" reignited within her, her eyes now gleaming with dangerous resolve. This time, Zoe seeks to follow a new and thrilling discipline, carving out her own Eden in the apocalypse.";
"item_description_key1005015"="Once a noble heiress, Audrey has transformed into an avenging angel. The destruction of her family and the disappearance of her bodyguard ignited a fire of vengeance within her. Fueled by hatred, she used her family's influence to have Tyrell Corporation enhance her genes, giving her extraordinary abilities. Impulsive and decisive, Audrey never backs down from a challenge. Despite her noble birth, she retains a strong sense of justice. The fire that once lay hidden behind her family's prestige now burns fiercely in the apocalypse, revealing her true power.";
"item_description_key1005016"="Diva was once a happy, sweet girl whose bright smile lit up everyone around her. But the apocalypse changed everything. In this harsh world, she took up heavy artillery, becoming a fearsome force on the battlefield. Though she still looks like a high school girl, inside she harbors the spirit of a rampaging warrior. In combat, Diva is ruthless and unleashes her full firepower, determined to obliterate every enemy.

Event Rules
1. During the event, use Pumpkin Bombs to attack the Pumpkin Infected and earn rewards and Fun Coins. You can acquire a large number of Pumpkin Bombs by purchasing the Curious Night Pack.\n
2. There are three types of Pumpkin Infected. Click the switch button to choose between them. Attacking or defeating them will grant rich rewards:
- Pumpkin Infected: Defeating this chest may spawn a Mysterious Pumpkin Infected.
- Mysterious Pumpkin Infected: Offers better rewards when attacked or defeated, but it might escape when hit! The more attacks you land, the higher your chance to claim the massive Pumpkin Bomb in Curious Night Treasure!
- Super Pumpkin Infected: Refreshes at a set time daily and can only be defeated once per day. After defeating it, you'll get a chance for luxurious rewards, with the results announced the next day!\n
3. If you choose the "Attack x10" option but defeat the Pumpkin Infected before using all 10 attacks, the remaining Pumpkin Bombs will be returned to your Backpack. Be sure to use your Pumpkin Bombs before the event ends, as they will disappear after the event.\n
4. You can claim a free chest, and once your Fun Points reach a specified value, you can also claim a Points Chest. Both can only be claimed once per day.\n

Players can also adjust battle plans freely.\n5. Adjustment Period [Every Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 00:00-19:00] (Alliances cannot change during this period). Players can change battle plans freely. Alliance leaders and managers can adjust the battle order of players within their lane or swap two lanes entirely based on the enemy's setup. After this period ends, battle plans, player order, and lane swaps will be locked.\n6. Waiting Period [Every Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 19:00-20:00] (Alliances cannot change or disband). No further changes can be made to battle plans, player order, or lane swaps during this period.\n7. Battle Period [Every Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 20:00-22:00] (Alliances cannot change or disband). Once battle begins, players fight one by one according to the battle order in their lanes. When one Alliance in a lane has no remaining members able to fight, that lane's match ends. The Alliance that wins in two out of three lanes secures victory in the Alliance Duel.\n8. Reward Period [Every Wednesday, Thursday, Friday after 22:00] Battle rewards are settled based on match outcomes. Weekly ranking rewards are based on individual and Alliance points ranking.\n9. Battle points earned from settlements can be exchanged for items in the Battle Shop.";

"beauty_system_chat_100019204_29"="Dawn Bringer pressed a soft goodnight kiss to her forehead.";
"beauty_system_chat_100019204_30"="Silly… only the excess data is getting wiped. Our memories? I already secured a dual-person bio-drive for them.";

"beauty_system_chat_100019205_7"="Haha! Emilius, I was actually going to ask where you got those bunny keychains from.";
"beauty_system_chat_100019205_8"="Just how many more adorable little secrets are you hiding from me?";
"beauty_system_chat_100019205_9"="Emilius instantly turned bright red, burying her face under the blanket in embarrassment.";

"beauty_system_chat_100019205_18"="Dawn Bringer let out a quiet chuckle.";
"beauty_system_chat_100019205_19"="Scooping up a spoonful of cake, they gently placed it in Emilius's mouth.";
"beauty_system_chat_100019205_20"="Then, they gave her cheek a little pinch.";
"beauty_system_chat_100019205_21"="Mmph…";
"beauty_system_chat_100019205_22"="Her cheeks puffed up with cream, the tips of her ears turning pink.";
"beauty_system_chat_100019205_23"="…Eh?";
"beauty_system_chat_100019205_24"="Seeing her blush, trying so hard to avoid eye contact, was absolutely adorable.";

"beauty_system_chat_100019205_26"="That's ridiculous. Since when does collecting cute little trinkets make you any less capable?";
"beauty_system_chat_100019205_27"="No. The Emilius I care about collects pretty stones, secretly feeds virtual pets, and dreams of pink starry skies…";
"beauty_system_chat_100019205_28"="And that—";

"item_description_key1005028"="A discarded mechanical Valkyrie that fell from Sky City—the domain of the Celestials.
During her fall, her core system and body structure were nearly destroyed, making reactivation virtually impossible. But after the Dawn Bringer reactivated her system, she managed to repair herself at astonishing speed.
Her entire body is equipped with awe-inspiring technological modules, granting her formidable combat capabilities. Unlike other Valkyries who were once ordinary human girls, Ophelia is a fully-fledged bionic machine.
However, as a mechanical Valkyrie, she lacks basic societal and social knowledge, often causing awkward but amusing moments within the United Front.";

"item_description_key1005027"="A girl who fights using the latest gravity-based weapons, throwing powerful gravity bombs like a baseball pitcher to crush her enemies.
The massive mechanical arms on her back possess incredible strength yet are extremely heavy. She relies on a matching anti-gravity device to wield them nimbly as single-soldier armaments. Consequently, she often misjudges her throwing force, resulting in unexpected destruction.
Her dream is to venture into the vast cosmos after defeating the Infected, to personally touch that boundless starry sky.";
